title: "'What is Music?' ...Again"

Sometimes when my mom introduces me to someone, she points out that we’re both musicians to give us some common ground. But I try to think about music less like a musician and more like everyone else.

Many have some pretty overblown ideas about “what music is”. To classical musicians, music captures the ineffable, unspeakable truths which can’t be conveyed elsewhere. To theorists, it is made up of structures and archetypes and cultural signification. And to many others, it is some form of high art or creative passion.

But I try to think about music in terms of where it shows up every day; there is kitchen-cleaning music, running music, background party music, and sometimes, concert music. In that context, then we can ponder and contemplate. But you wouldn’t have the same attitude towards the more mundane kinds of music. You could, but probably only as a joke - pointing out the different worlds these musics are for, but leaving that difference intact.

This is where many awe-inspiring sentences that start with “Music is…” break down because they are too narrow. There could be some passionate performances recorded on your dinner party playlist, but the reason you put it on was for its sound, not the emotions it would stir up in you. The “Music is…” people have to either back up and broaden their definition or say, “Well, I was really just talking about *this* kind of music.”

The people who back up and broaden their definition could be forced into backing up again and again until just about anything could be called music. Let’s see if your definition can hold up:

Is music…

Tonal? (counterexample: [Schoenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schoenberg#Development_of_the_twelve-tone_method))  
Pitched? (Electronic music, percussion music)  
Made of sound? ([John Cage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4%E2%80%B233%E2%80%B3) and [many others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_silent_musical_compositions))   
Expressive? ([Stravinsky](https://scholarsbank.uoregon.edu/xmlui/handle/1794/12469))  
Man-made? ([John Cage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cage#Chance), [David Cope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cope))  
Art? ([Muzak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muzak))  
Repeatable? ([Ornette Coleman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornette_Coleman#1960:_Free_Jazz))  
A positive influence? ([Richard Wagner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wagner#Racism_and_antisemitism), [The Taliban](https://www.news24.com/World/News/Now-Taliban-bans-the-music-20010430))  

Of course, you could point to any one of those examples and say, [“Well, that’s not *real* music.”](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/no-true-scotsman) And that’s probably the only way to maintain a definition of music that has any meaning. But the fact is, every one of those examples has lots and lots of people who really think it is music. Now it’s your word against theirs, and nobody is likely to change their mind.

On the other hand, you can say that “Music is all-encompassing,” and includes anything that anyone considers is music. Nobody can really say no, but you’re entering the bounds of philosophy and exiting the world of practical language. There are all kinds of different thoughts about what “love” really is, or what “the mind” really is, but when we use those words in a sentence, we’re talking about the basic ideas that most people would agree on; for love, some kind of deep affection; for the mind, the center of your thoughts, and for music, the stuff we listen to for fun or to accompany a certain mood. It’s just practical.

I’ve found this way of thinking to help me understand music that was confusing before, or at least keep from being too pretentious; it helps me take workout remixes and party playlists just as seriously as “serious” pieces. It’s one of the first questions ethnomusicologists ask about the music of a foreign culture; what do they *use* it for? If the practical approach can demystify an ancient folk song tradition, could it help us appreciate the kinds of music we’ve avoided for too long?
